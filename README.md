Grade Calculator Application & Software Testing 

Used python & the Tkinter tool kit to build a grade calculation application. The application calculates the weight of a final exam in a course, the grade needed on a final exam for a desired course grade, and the course grade after the final exam. Software testing was conducted for this project using methods including boundary value testing, path and coverage testing, code coverage, mutation testing and system testing.
